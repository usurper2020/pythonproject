"""
This module manages dependencies for a Python project.

It imports various libraries and modules that are required for the project's functionality.
Some of the imports are from cx_Freeze hooks, which are used for creating standalone executables.
Other imports are common libraries used for web scraping, database management, network scanning, and machine learning.

Imports:
    - tensorflow and pyside6 from cx_Freeze.hooks
    - pyside6: A set of Python bindings for Qt
    - requests: HTTP library for making requests
    - beautifulsoup4: Library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
    - sqlalchemy: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library
    - nmap: Library for network discovery and security auditing
    - sqlmap: Automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool
    - scikit-learn: Machine learning library (assigned to 'var')
    - tensorflow: Open-source machine learning framework

Note:
    This is not a function, but rather a series of import statements and variable assignments.
    The actual functionality would need to be implemented using these imported modules.
